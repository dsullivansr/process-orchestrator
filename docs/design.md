# Process Orchestrator Design Document

## Overview
The Process Orchestrator is a system designed to efficiently manage multiple instances of a binary process, automatically scaling based on system resources and custom metrics. It uses a plugin-based architecture for extensibility and configures execution via YAML configuration files.

## Core Components

### 1. Configuration Management
#### Config File Structure (config.yaml)
```yaml
binary:
  path: "/path/to/binary"
  flags:
    - "--input-file={input_file}"
    - "--output-file={output_file}"
    - "--other-flag=value"

input:
  files_directory: "/path/to/input/files"
  file_pattern: "*.dat"  # Optional: glob pattern for input files

output:
  directory: "/path/to/output"
  file_suffix: ".output"

resource_limits:
  cpu_threshold_percent: 80
  memory_threshold_percent: 75
  disk_usage_threshold_percent: 90

calibration:
  enabled: true
  warmup_time_seconds: 30  # Time to wait for process to stabilize
  calibration_duration: 60  # Time to measure resource usage

plugins:
  metrics:
    - name: "system_metrics"
      enabled: true
      class: "SystemMetricsCollector"
    - name: "connection_counter"
      enabled: true
      class: "ConnectionMetricsCollector"
      config:
        ports: [8080, 8081]

  capacity:
    - name: "resource_capacity"
      enabled: true
      class: "SystemResourceCapacity"
    - name: "custom_capacity"
      enabled: false
      class: "CustomCapacityCalculator"
      config:
        max_connections: 1000
```

### 2. Plugin System

#### 2.1 Metrics Plugin Interface
```python
class MetricsCollectorPlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def initialize(self, config: dict) -> None:
        """Initialize the plugin with configuration"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def collect_metrics(self, process: Process) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Collect metrics for a specific process"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def collect_system_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Collect system-wide metrics"""
        pass
```

#### 2.2 Capacity Calculator Plugin Interface
```python
class CapacityCalculatorPlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def initialize(self, config: dict) -> None:
        """Initialize the calculator with configuration"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_capacity(self,
                         calibration_metrics: Dict[str, float],
                         current_metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> int:
        """Calculate how many processes can run based on metrics"""
        pass
```

### 3. Process Management

#### 3.1 Calibration Phase
- Run a single instance of the binary
- Collect metrics over specified duration
- Calculate baseline resource usage
- Store calibration results for capacity planning

#### 3.2 Execution Phase
1. Load and validate configuration
2. Initialize plugins
3. Perform calibration if enabled
4. Scan input directory for files to process
5. Main execution loop:
   - Monitor system resources via plugins
   - Calculate available capacity
   - Spawn/terminate processes based on capacity
   - Track process completion and output files
   - Handle process failures and retries

### 4. Metrics Collection and Monitoring

#### 4.1 Built-in Metrics
- CPU usage per process and system-wide
- Memory usage (RSS, virtual memory)
- Disk I/O (read/write operations, bytes)
- Process count and states
- Queue length (pending files)

#### 4.2 Custom Metrics (via plugins)
- Network connections
- Custom resource usage
- Application-specific metrics
- External service dependencies

### 5. Process Lifecycle Management

#### 5.1 States
- PENDING: File waiting to be processed
- CALIBRATING: Measuring resource usage
- RUNNING: Active processing
- COMPLETED: Successfully finished
- FAILED: Error occurred
- TERMINATED: Stopped due to resource constraints

#### 5.2 Error Handling
- Process crash recovery
- Resource exhaustion handling
- Output file validation
- Retry mechanism with backoff
